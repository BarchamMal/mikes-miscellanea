# Mikes Miscellanea
A mod that adds a bunch of random stuff.

## Description
A mod with all the things that didn't fit into my other mods.
I would've named it "Random Things" but apparently that name is already taken.

## FAQ

- Q: May I use this mod in my modpack?
- A: Of course! Just credit me and provide a link to this repo.

* Q: Will you port this mod to X version?
* A: If X is before 1.20.2 then no, I don't plan to.
* A: If X is after 1.20.2 then yes, when the Fabric APIs are updated.

- Q: Will you port this mod to Forge?
- A: No. I don't plan to.
- E: The Fabric APIs are very easy to use, and I am not experienced enough to port it to Forge.
